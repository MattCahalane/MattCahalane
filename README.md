# Personal GitHub Profile: Matthew Cahalane

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a showcase of my technical skills, interests, and contributions. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me.

## About Me

I am passionate about software development, open-source projects, and continuous learning. My current focus is on mastering various technologies and contributing to meaningful projects.

## Expertise

### Deep Understanding

#### Clojure
- I have extensive experience with Clojure, a functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

#### ClojureScript
- ClojureScript is my go-to choice for front-end development. It compiles to JavaScript and allows me to write consistent code across the stack.

#### PostGreSql
- Proficient in working with PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

#### Gradle
- I use Gradle for build automation. It simplifies managing dependencies, compiling code, and creating artifacts.

#### Liquibase
- Liquibase helps me manage database schema changes over time. It ensures consistency and version control for database migrations.

#### Clojurephant
- Clojurephant, a Gradle plugin, streamlines my Clojure and ClojureScript projects. It integrates seamlessly with our build process[^1^][3].

#### GitLab & Jenkins CI
- I rely on GitLab for version control and Jenkins CI for automated build and deployment pipelines.

### Good Understanding

#### Rust Programming
- Rust fascinates me with its memory safety, performance, and expressive syntax. I enjoy exploring Rust projects and contributing to the community.

#### Docker
- Docker simplifies packaging applications and their dependencies into containers. It ensures consistency across environments and facilitates deployment.

## Current Interests

### Solidity
- I'm diving into Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Exploring blockchain development and decentralized applications (DApps) excites me.

### Rust
- Rust continues to intrigue me due to its strong type system, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency. I see its potential in various domains.
