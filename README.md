# Matthew Cahalane
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” Software engineer Â· Clojure & Rust enthusiast Â· Blockchain explorer

---

## About
Building reliable, elegant systems with a focus on fullâ€‘stack Clojure/ClojureScript, robust JVM tooling, and modern infra. I like concise abstractions, strong types where useful, and reproducible builds.

---

## Highlights
- Clojure / ClojureScript â€” functional design, idiomatic tooling, UI composition  
- Rust â€” safe, high-performance systems and WebAssembly experiments  
- Databases & CI â€” PostgreSQL tuning, Liquibase migrations, Gradle & Clojurephant, GitLab/Jenkins pipelines  
- Containers & Automation â€” Docker-driven workflows and deployable artefacts

---

## Graphs & Visualizations
I build clean, interactive visualizations to explore data and systems: transaction/network graphs, performance dashboards, and observability views. Typical toolset: D3/Vega/Observable, Grafana/Prometheus, and lightweight SVG/WebGL renderers for highâ€‘density data.

---

## Current Interests
- Solidity & smart contracts â€” secure patterns and developer tooling  
- Rust for systems & Wasm â€” performance where it matters  
- Exploratory dashboards â€” making complex data feel intuitive
